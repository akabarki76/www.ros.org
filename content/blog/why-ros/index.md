ROS (Robot Operating System) is an open source software development kit for
robotics applications. ROS offers a standard software platform to developers
across industries that will carry them from research and prototyping all the way through to
deployment and production.

**Don't reinvent the wheel. Create something new and do it faster and better by building on ROS!**

### Global Community

For over 10+ years the ROS project has produced a vast ecosystem of software for
robotics by nurturing a global community of millions of developers and users
who contribute to and improve that software. ROS is developed by and for that
community, who will be its stewards into the future.

### Proven in Use

ROS is relied upon throughout the robotics industry. It's the norm for
[teaching robotics](http://wiki.ros.org/Courses). It's the basis for most
robotics research, from [single-student
projects](https://www.makr.org/2021/scorpio) to [multi-institution
collaborations](http://swarms.eu) and [large-scale
competitions](https://www.subtchallenge.com/). And it's inside robots that are
running in production all around the world today. In the autonomous mobile
robot (AMR) alone, ROS has helped to create
[billions](https://locusrobotics.com/our_news/meet-the-newest-robotics-unicorn-locus-robotics-raises-150-million-at-a-1-billion-valuation-on-surging-e-commerce-sales/)

### Shorten Time to Market

ROS provides the tools, libraries, and capabilities that you need to develop
your robotics applications, allowing you to spend more time on the work that is
important for your business. Because it is open-source, you have the
flexibility to decide where and how to use ROS, as well as the freedom to
customize it for your needs. Moreover, ROS isn't exclusive, you don't need to choose between ROS or some other software stack; ROS easily integrates with your existing software to bring its tools to your problem. 

### Multi-domain

ROS is ready for use across a wide array of robotics applications, from indoor
to outdoor, home to automotive, underwater to space, and consumer to
industrial.

### Multi-platform

ROS 2 is supported and tested on Linux, Windows, and macOS, as well as various
embedded platforms (via [micro-ROS](https://micro.ros.org/)), allowing seamless
development and deployment of on-robot autonomy, back-end management, and user
interfaces. The tiered support model allows for ports to new platforms, such as
real-time and embedded operating systems, to be introduced and promoted as they gain interest
and investment.

### 100% Open-source

ROS is and always will be open-source, ensuring that our global community has
free and unfettered access to a high-quality, best-in-class, fully featured
robotics SDK. We build ROS atop other open source projects and we leverage and
follow open standards (such as [OMG's
DDS](https://design.ros2.org/articles/ros_on_dds.html)) wherever possible.

### Commercial Friendly

While we earnestly encourage open source contributions to ROS from our user
community, we never demand it. We distribute ROS under permissive open source
licenses, with [Apache 2.0](https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.html)
being our default. You're welcome to modify ROS, mix it together with your own
and others' non-open software, and distribute the result in your proprietary
product, and you don't even need to tell us about it. Of course, we always
enjoy hearing what our users are up to with ROS, so please do [let us
know](https://discourse.ros.org/c/ros-projects) if you're able!


### Industry Support

Companies large and small from around the world are
committing their resources to making open source contributions to ROS 2, in
addition to developing products on top.
