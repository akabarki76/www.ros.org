## ROS 1 Noetic Ninjemys goes End-of-Life 2024-05-31

When we [announced](https://www.openrobotics.org/blog/2020/5/23/noetic-ninjemys-the-last-official-ros-1-release) ROS 1 Noetic Ninjemys on May 23rd, 2020 we made it very clear that it would be the last official ROS 1 distribution. 
In the proceeding five years we focused our efforts on making ROS 2 a world class framework for professional robot development, and our user community seems to agree.
According to September 2024 download data from our servers ROS 2 downloads now make up almost 80% of all ROS downloads.
We've now seen ROS 2 used successfully in production by a large number of companies, across dozens of industries, and we think it is time for the last remaining ROS users to make the switch. 

If you have been directed to this page it was probably because you saw one of the notifications we slipped into the source code for ROS Noetic or RViz. 
We've heard from a number of users that they were unaware that ROS 1 Noetic, and consequently all of 1, will go end-of-life on **May 31st, 2025**.
We're sorry that we interrupted your work, but it is crucial that you know what happens once ROS 1 goes end-of-life.

## What Does End-of-Life Mean?

Users often ask us, “what does end of life mean?” 
To put it briefly, end of life means that the ROS team will no longer support that particular ROS release. 
In practical terms, this means that we will no longer be providing the following for any ROS 1 release, including Noetic:

* New features or capabilities
* Security updates
* Bug fixes, patches or support
* Updated binaries

In partical terms, this means that after May 31st, 2025 ROS 1 Noetic will progressively become more difficult to support or use.  

It is also worth *noting the things that won’t change after ROS 1* goes end of life:

* ROS 1 binaries will not suddenly disappear
* Users will not need to migrate immediately, but they should migrate as soon as possible
* Your ROS 1 project will not suddenly stop working on May 31st

## What are My Upgrade Options?

If you are still using ROS 1 it is time to consider switching to ROS 2 Humble Hawksbill or ROS 2 Jazzy Jalisco.
